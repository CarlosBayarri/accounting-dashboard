# AccountingDashboard

  This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 11.0.2. Access here: https://carlosbayarri.github.io/accounting-dashboard/.
  It is based on a dashboard to manage income and expenses. In this application the Redux pattern is used to create a store to store user information, income, expenses and colleagues. All data is hosted on Firebase and managed by Firestore, with the exception of colleagues, which are obtained through a rest api. An effect has been designed that listens to the action of colleagues and connects to their service.
